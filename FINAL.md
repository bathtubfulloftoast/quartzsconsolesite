# What happened to serpos console?

Serpos console has been oficially discontinued as of april 14th 2024 after almost a year of constant development.
As i understand it serpos console was discontinued due to general demotivation
After a confusing merge between quartz console and serpos console everything just fell apart.

What got you into developing for quartz/serpo?
After an official beta release on the minecraft architect server on 03/27/2023 quartzs console i had seen that quartzmaven (the guy from the thing) had been sharing quartzconsole releases via dropbox.
After seeing that and going “i wish these releases could all be in once place. … wait i can do that.” then i had asked him “hey do you want a site?”
And he said yes!
And the rest is history

# What Now?
Well if youve been following the site this intently you might notice the fact this is a subdomain of a different site.

That is my main project where i shove alot of my most random shit
My more complex shit and more well
Lets say
Properly arranged.
…
Shit.

If you wish to follow quartz or serpo you can still find them on their usual avenues

# About serpos console
From what i understand osmo is the real leader of serpos console
osmo was the main person i talked to at least
and while i only spoke to them briefly within the context of serpos console
id like to thank them for what theyve done for serpos console
and sincerely hope anyone from the serpos console team can feel comfortable inviting me to any future projects

# Why say anything?
quartz console was truly my first time working for anyone
and it taught me alot about how to do such a thing
what to expect and the results
while i only made about 3 pages and nothing all that extensive
what i did do taught me a bit
i didn't do much of the hard work but im proud i was able to work on what i did.

i say all of this because
well
im a sentimental bitch at heart
plus leaving an unedited page with nothing but a “this page is archived” banner isnt as interesting.

for those of you who read
thank you for being a part of this project.
i hope the future is bright
